## About source data

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## About R script

File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform the following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):
* Downlowading the data set
* Unzip dataSet to /data directory
* Reading the different files
   + Reading training data
   + Reading testing data
   + Reading features 
   + Reading activity labels
   + Assiging Colum Names

1. Merging Data into one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.From the data set in the above step , creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
5. Writing tidy data in text file


## About variables:

### The Following Contains all the  Training Data downloaded:
* x_train
* y_train
* subject_train

### The Following Contains all the Testing Data downloaded:
* x_test
* y_test
* subject_test 

## Identifiers

* subject - The ID of the test subject
* activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## The following is after bind all the test data and training data 
* test_data 
* train_data 

## The merged Data set:
* merged_data 


## Final Data set :
* tidyDataSet
